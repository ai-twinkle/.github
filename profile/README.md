ðŸŒŸ **Twinkle AI** is a Traditional Chinese language model research community founded in late 2024. Starting with the open-source LLaMA models, we are gradually building practical technologies tailored for Traditional Chinese. Our community is made up of people from all walks of life, united by a shared passion for model training. From collecting Traditional Chinese corpora to training language models, we are committed to open-sourcing both our datasets and our models.

Our mission is to promote knowledge of large language model training through real-world practices. By embracing openness and collaboration, we aim to advance Taiwanâ€™s development in the field of generative AI.

### Open-Source Projects
- **[Twinkle Eval](https://github.com/ai-twinkle/Eval)**: A fast and accurate AI evaluation tool that uses parallel and randomized testing methods to provide objective performance analysis and stability assessments. It supports various commonly used benchmark datasets.
